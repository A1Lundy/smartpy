Within the subdirectory `in`, a subsubdirectory having the same name as the catchment to be modelled must be created: this is in this directory that SMARTpy will be looking for the input files. Following this setup, all the catchments the user desires to model can be gathered in one place, and it makes things much easier when dealing with large samples."

In a similar way, the SMART instance gives you access (after simulation) to the simulated discharge. You can then evaluate these two series using one of the objective functions available in smartpy.objfunctions (for example the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency here)."
